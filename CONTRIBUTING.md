# Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

# Reporting issues
Please try to answer the following questions in your bug report:

What did you do?
What did you expect to happen?
What happened instead?
Make sure to include as much relevant information as possible. Ruby version, Regexing version, OS version and any stack traces you have are very valuable.

# Pull Requests
Add tests! Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

Document any change in behaviour. Make sure the README and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

Create topic branches. Please don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

One pull request per feature. If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

Send coherent history. Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before sending them to us.
